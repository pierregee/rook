#### What is rook?

  - It aims to create layout components to ease the pain of doing responsive work

<b> Inspired by </b> styled-system and Seek design system

#### How to Use

<b>To use this in development mode, </b>
`npm link ./../your_lib/node_modules/react`

> "This problem can also come up when you use npm link or an equivalent. In that case, your bundler might “see” two Reacts — one in application folder and one in your library folder. Assuming myapp and mylib are sibling folders, one possible fix is to run npm link ../myapp/node_modules/react from mylib. This should make the library use the application’s React copy."
